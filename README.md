# Spartan Security
Spartan Security is a web application that provides predictive and descriptive analytics of crimes in the Baltimore city. This application is based on a machine learning model that uses expanding window forecasting technique to predict the number of crimes in upcoming week.  In this project we have used the **Victim Based Crime data** and **Census data** from the Baltimore open data website. Using Census data we calculated the population of different police districts in the Baltimore city. By combining the crime data and census data we are predicting the number of crimes per 10k population for the upcoming week.
